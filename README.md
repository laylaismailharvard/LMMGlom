This project explores various approaches to analyzing genes of interest from the kidney glomeruli of human tissue, including both genes that showed significant changes (GOI) and those that did not (NGOI). The analyses examine changes over time (Timepoint Analysis) and across four different treatments, utilizing methods such as Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment, linear mixed models, and differential gene expression. In the NGOI Timepoint Analysis file, special attention is given to pathway analysis, with the integration of different gene pathway APIs to visualize pathway expression changes over time.
